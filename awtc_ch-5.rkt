;; Playing around with listing all compositions, an answer to Chen's question
;; https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140714-00/?p=513
;; Question:
;; If you wanted to generate all compositions of any length,
;; you could do it by generating all compositions of length 1,
;; then compositions of length 2, and so on up to length n.
;; Whatâ€™s the easier way of doing it?
;; Easier would be to generate all subsets of (n-1)

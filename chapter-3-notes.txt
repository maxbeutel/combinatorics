a)

# Observe that they play on each day of a week, that is they play 7 matches with at most 3! = 6 different possible outcomes (as there were no ties.)


b)

# The question is, whether there would be enough unique arrangements of 4 players, so that for each of the 35 days there could be a different ranking (arrangement) of A, B, C, D.

# They play for 5 weeks, every day = 35 days.

# If there were no ties, then we have 4! = 24 possible rankings.
For 24 days we could have unique rankings, that is, all possible arrangements of A, B, C, D without ties.

# For the remaining days, there was no tie for spot 1/2 and no tie for 3/4, but there could've been a tie for spot 2/3.
The possible choices for the tie spots is 4 C 2 = 6, and the remaining 2 spots 1 and 4 can be choosen in 2 ways.
In total, for the remaining 35-24 = 11 days, there are 6*2 = 12 possible rankings.

# So in total we could have 36 all different rankings for 35 days, so it is possible that no two days had the same ranking.

c)

# As it is a round-robin match, each player has 3 matches in white and 3 matches in black, for a total of 6 matches per day.

# Each match has 3 outcomes, white wins, black wins, draw.
Describe the result of a day as a set with 6 elements:
{ ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? }
For example:
{ W, B, D, D, W, B }
Here white wins, black wins, draw, draw, white wins, black wins.

# Consider the total amount of unique outcomes: 3^6 = 729, that is, the total of 6-element sets formed from W, B, D.
That is, they will play for at most 729 days, after that one of the previous results has to be repeated (so this is the upper bound, 2 years).
